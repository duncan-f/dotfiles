2018-08-23 19:06:45	duncan213	unmy: i realy dont understand but thank you anyways
2018-08-23 19:09:06	unmy	duncan213, "The Intel graphics driver in X.Org intends to support all intel chipsets from the i810 and upwards. Please note that this driver does not support the GMA 500, found in various Atom-based designs."
2018-08-23 19:09:48	duncan213	unmy: lol
2018-08-23 19:10:06	unmy	it isn't typical intel gpu but known form atom cpu's and will work with "modesetting" driver or with just "fbdev"
2018-08-23 19:10:09	duncan213	unmy: i'm 100% sure i've installed void on this computer before
2018-08-23 19:10:57	unmy	duncan213, and maybe before it done something automaticly and was fine or maybe need try with older kernel
2018-08-23 19:11:34	duncan213	unmy: maybe it's that because i installed the 4.9 before
2018-08-23 19:11:57	duncan213	and it is pulling the 4.17
2018-08-23 19:11:57	unmy	was working on 4.9 so install 4.9

2018-08-24 12:10:07	TheAnachron	make a backup before ...

2018-08-24 12:12:10	duncan213	TheAnachron: thx
2018-08-24 12:12:17	TheAnachron	good luck. will take quite some time until you figured how to do it and make it look good :)

2018-08-24 12:24:58	ronin7z	my internet keeps disconnecting, so well anyone know how to fix steam :)
2018-08-24 12:25:21	malice	In theory, sdl has backends that should permit something similar, but I have never got it to work in practice
2018-08-24 12:26:01	malice	Someone appears to have stolen the directfb.org domain name
2018-08-24 12:26:02	malice	:(

2018-08-24 12:26:23	malice	Initial look, sure, looks fine
2018-08-24 12:26:23	TheAnachron	ronin7z make a bakcup of ~/.steam/steam, delete the folder and start steam
2018-08-24 12:26:30	malice	And then you see an article in the sidebar

2018-08-24 12:26:38	ronin7z	TheAnachron: hmmm i tried that
2018-08-24 12:26:46	malice	And oooh yeah, this is totally legit directfb page
2018-08-24 12:26:48	ronin7z	or rather i deleted .local/steam/steam
2018-08-24 12:26:48	malice	No doubt about it
2018-08-24 12:26:50	malice	At all
2018-08-24 12:26:59	TheAnachron	ronin7z but that's another directory.
2018-08-24 12:27:13	TheAnachron	ah wait
2018-08-24 12:27:21	ronin7z	yee, i tried deleting the oen you mentioned as well
2018-08-24 12:27:22	ronin7z	same problem
2018-08-24 12:27:26	TheAnachron	my ~/.steam links to ~/.local/share/Steam
2018-08-24 12:27:28	TheAnachron	did you mean that dir?
2018-08-24 12:27:32	ronin7z	yee
2018-08-24 12:27:41	ronin7z	i just deleted the whole folder and then steam launched
2018-08-24 12:27:47	ronin7z	but if i try to opt in the beta, it doesnt laucnh anymore
2018-08-24 12:27:51	malice	I don't remember having a .steam on arch
2018-08-24 12:27:53	TheAnachron	that's weird. I just updated my steam and all is well. :/
2018-08-24 12:27:56	FreeFull	malice: Yeah, that's really unfortunate
2018-08-24 12:28:05	TheAnachron	probably something broken for you ronin7z :/
2018-08-24 12:28:06	malice	ronin7z: Someone had a similar issue recently I think
2018-08-24 12:28:12	ronin7z	yee it is really weird
2018-08-24 12:28:13	FreeFull	With directfb
2018-08-24 12:28:19	ronin7z	like there doesnt seem to be any reason it hsould do this
2018-08-24 12:28:24	FreeFull	It was a promising project that just ended up.. ending
2018-08-24 12:28:27	malice	May have been you actually, ronin7z

2018-08-24 12:31:08	ronin7z	sorry
2018-08-24 12:31:25	ronin7z	how do i even do that in grub, im used to refind
2018-08-24 12:31:29	ronin7z	but void installer installed grub
2018-08-24 12:31:51	malice	I'm used to manually managing uefi boot entries cuz wtf are bootloaders
2018-08-24 12:32:06	malice	They are always so difficult to deal with. :(
2018-08-24 12:32:14	ronin7z	i find them quite conveneint
2018-08-24 12:32:16	ronin7z	especially refind
2018-08-24 12:32:49	malice	Actually, efibootmgr is a bit annoying on void
2018-08-24 12:33:01	malice	Because all kernel updates create separate files
2018-08-24 12:33:03	TheAnachron	actually I find grub quite nice and I don't understand the hate for it.
2018-08-24 12:33:44	FreeFull	malice: There should be an fb backend and a drm backend
2018-08-24 12:33:52	FreeFull	Warning though, from my past testing they have been rather buggy
2018-08-24 12:34:10	FreeFull	Often, the program would freeze and you'd be a bit screwed
2018-08-24 12:34:39	malice	FreeFull: Both say the backend is not available
2018-08-24 12:34:41	FreeFull	It's better to just run SDL programs under X or Wayland
2018-08-24 12:34:53	malice	Need some deps?
2018-08-24 12:35:03	FreeFull	malice: Maybe your version of SDL was compiled without support for them
2018-08-24 12:35:15	malice	Just the one from void repos, dunno

2018-08-24 19:40:38	duncan213	good finaly i could install an old kernel
2018-08-24 19:40:42	duncan213	4.9
2018-08-24 19:41:02	duncan213	i think i can update it up to 4.12
2018-08-24 19:41:30	duncan213	i think the problem was in the intel firmware packages
2018-08-24 19:41:43	unmy	duncan213, ah I forgot to tell you to remove them
2018-08-24 19:41:49	TheAnachron	ah interesting.
2018-08-24 19:41:59	unmy	at least dri ones for xorg
2018-08-24 19:42:14	duncan213	unmy: yes it was the issue
2018-08-24 19:42:33	duncan213	now i'm struggling with NetworkManager
2018-08-24 19:42:55	unmy	ye sorry, assumed at the begining that got intel card and not some frankenstein thing :)
2018-08-24 19:43:31	TheAnachron	network manager.
2018-08-24 19:43:32	unmy	duncan213, and with which xorg driver working now? hope modesetting because should support it best
2018-08-24 19:43:39	TheAnachron	I only hear people complaining about it and having issues with it
2018-08-24 19:43:46	TheAnachron	even I had problems with it when I was back on gnome
2018-08-24 19:43:52	duncan213	unmy: yes it's modesetting
2018-08-24 19:44:03	TheAnachron	just use good old wpa_supplicant with dhcpd and tadaaa
2018-08-24 19:44:28	unmy	duncan213, oh good to hear so at least now you know what you got and with what should work, good job!
2018-08-24 19:44:45	duncan213	unmy: thx
2018-08-24 19:45:13	duncan213	TheAnachron: i'll do it with wpa_supplicant it's the only solution
2018-08-24 19:46:31	duncan213	now thinking of it, is there a way to upgrade packages with excluding some
2018-08-24 19:47:01	unmy	duncan213, better stay with 4.9 kernel, 4.12 is already done and not supported
2018-08-24 19:47:26	duncan213	ohh ok thnx unmy 
2018-08-24 19:48:17	gyre	wpa_supplicant works great but i really want something like wicd-curses that doesn't crash so much
2018-08-24 19:48:40	unmy	duncan213,  still you can even try 4.18 or you think that won't work?
2018-08-24 19:49:42	duncan213	unmy: i don't know if it'll work
2018-08-24 19:50:44	unmy	you can always try and if won't then select in grub previous version
2018-08-24 19:51:18	unmy	I see on kernel.org that 4.19 will be next LTS
2018-08-24 19:51:29	TheAnachron	Gottox are you there? I was wondering why xbps-query -m does not show all the manual packages I installed.
2018-08-24 19:55:51	duncaen	why wouldnt it show all
2018-08-24 19:56:15	TheAnachron	no idea. I have a bunch of packages that show in -l but not in -m ... which I installed manually.
2018-08-24 19:56:21	TheAnachron	autofs is one of them
2018-08-24 19:56:45	unmy	TheAnachron, dependencies doesn't count as manualy installed
2018-08-24 19:56:59	TheAnachron	? autofs wasn't a dependency
2018-08-24 19:57:04	TheAnachron	I installed it via xbps-install autofs
2018-08-24 19:57:17	TheAnachron	because I wanted to auto-mount my usb drive using autofs
2018-08-24 19:57:44	duncaen	I don't have an explanation for that
2018-08-24 19:57:54	duncaen	xbps-pkgdb can change the mode
2018-08-24 19:58:10	duncaen	and there is nothing that depends on autofs
2018-08-24 19:58:23	duncaen	check the package db file
2018-08-24 19:58:23	unmy	TheAnachron, working just fine for me
2018-08-24 19:59:22	TheAnachron	ok thanks I will manually change it I guess
