2018-07-01 15:08:49	tomreyn	it's an unusual use case, you are probably the first person to ever import 10K VPN profiles to network manager. so i'm wondering why you would, and whether there can be a better approach. trying to help yoiu, you know.
2018-07-01 15:10:24	juslintek	tomreyn, everything is automatized, but I manage monitoring settings, for streaming data to our main service, which is access only locally from our office. Okay imagine city scale intranets, which are used per town administration of different sectors all over the world. And we provide these services to them, but sometimes they have issues or we have changes in server settings so need to connect and tweak those settings for them.
2018-07-01 15:12:03	juslintek	And on some countries those services are hosted on windows machine, so need to connect via locally identifiable ip and then access from there web panel.

2018-07-01 15:13:46	juslintek	tomreyn, I'm not monitoring. I'm tweaking settings. But the services I'm tweaking settings are for minotoring basically graphana type of monitoring.
2018-07-01 15:14:19	juslintek	Grafana
2018-07-01 15:14:59	juslintek	Okay lets change the question. Is there any alternative system panels for gnome?
2018-07-01 15:15:32	juslintek	Or is there possibility to tweak their settings, maybe there are some alternative ui display methods?
2018-07-01 15:15:38	tomreyn	juslintek: you should probably have one headless system which sets up the vpn connection (and may store many openvpn - i assume - profiles). and then another system which runs a graphical desktop which then connect to the remote network though this headless server.

2018-07-01 15:21:27	juslintek	And they are probably only going to release linux UI in future, because minority of paid customers are from Linux and guess they use it for some other purposes, which do not require UI.

First one is that I don't have audio at all and second one is that whenever I play any video on any browser (html5), the video is choppy (it struggles and "jumps"), but when I download that exact same video and play it with VLC It plays perfectly. I haven't a clue on how could I fix it, audio isn't muted (already checked in alsamixer and

2018-07-16 11:52:35	ppf	the one reasonable scenario where it might help is where a trusted source get's infected. such has the windows update store or something. but i'd consider that so unlikely that it doesn't outweigh the insane security compromise you have to accept
