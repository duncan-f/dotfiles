Version 4.31 required to play, because we demand only the finest in Swedish programming. || <Ironybot> Dominions 4 is not-so-secretly a game about math. || <AFaceInTheCrowd> I feel like this is a bad game for bad people. || <guile2> I just want a quest like Golden Empire, where there's a plot, and sometimes you have sex with your love interest"
