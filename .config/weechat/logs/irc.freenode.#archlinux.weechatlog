2018-07-01 15:55:57	duncan213	guys is it possible to install arch without systemd ?
2018-07-01 15:56:19	thrice	hm, so iwd is the hot new wireless daemon; it seems NM has it available as an optdep, but still hard-deps on wpa_supplicant
2018-07-01 15:56:30	thrice	I guess there's not a great way to do that
2018-07-01 15:56:38	thrice	duncan213: no, not practically
2018-07-01 15:56:44	Namarrgon	duncan213: it's possible but you're pretty much on your own with it
2018-07-01 15:57:03	duncan213	ok thnx

2018-07-01 15:58:05	duncan213	is it even worth it  to change another distro just to change the system init ?

2018-07-01 15:58:22	thrice	well, why do you dislike systemd so much?
2018-07-01 15:58:36	Namarrgon	pick a distro that doesn't use systemd out of the box
2018-07-01 15:58:38	thrice	if it's because people on the internet told you should, then the answer is no
2018-07-01 15:59:56	duncan213	ok then i think i'll stick to systemd and read about it more :)
2018-07-01 16:00:42	thrice	most of the anti-systemd stuff comes from trolls.  it's not perfect, but it's pretty solid, it's best to decide for yourself
2018-07-01 16:00:42	earnestly	duncan213: If you want arch without systemd, use void

2018-07-01 16:01:04	earnestly	I wouldn't bother trying to change arch to use something else
2018-07-01 16:01:13	earnestly	guestkato: No?
2018-07-01 16:01:27	guestkato	oh, it took them a month but they seem to be back on track
2018-07-01 16:01:38	guestkato	their bus-factor of one caught up with them

2018-07-01 16:02:22	hoshineko	you can have arch with openrc if you do some dirty work
2018-07-01 16:02:32	hoshineko	there's even artix
2018-07-01 16:02:40	earnestly	hoshineko: Why would you want to go from a good init to a shit one?
2018-07-01 16:02:46	earnestly	At least void is sensible here

2018-07-01 16:05:45	guestkato	anyway, void's runit is pretty nice. but arch's systemd does work.
2018-07-01 16:06:01	hoshineko	runit is good
2018-07-01 16:06:04	hoshineko	void is terrible
2018-07-01 16:06:20	hoshineko	and i'm saying this from experience
2018-07-01 16:06:32	thrice	all distros suck, just pick the setup you find sucks the least
2018-07-01 16:07:05	hoshineko	nah, some are specially shitty

2018-07-01 16:08:34	hoshineko	well one of the things that happened when i was on void was that the mirror ran out of space (lol) which lead to a broken update which somehow made xbps segfault
