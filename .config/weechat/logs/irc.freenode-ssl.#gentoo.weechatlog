2018-07-17 14:43:08	codedmart	I just want to reduce home 50GB so I can create another 50GB vol.
2018-07-17 14:43:26	codedmart	I don't want to change the physical vol at all.
2018-07-17 14:44:00	+grknight	codedmart: so you have to reduce the size of the home FS first, then lvreduce the home volume
2018-07-17 14:44:14	codedmart	OK so what I read is correct.
2018-07-17 14:44:17	<--	cHawk (~chawk@p5090D3F6.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
2018-07-17 14:44:35	codedmart	I thought that maybe was reducing the physical vol.
2018-07-17 14:45:13	+grknight	pv = physical volume, vg = volume group, lv = logical volume
2018-07-17 14:46:34	+grknight	a vg contains one or more pv;  several lv can belong to a vg;  the job of the vg is to allocate its lv across the pv assigned to it
2018-07-17 14:46:48	codedmart	So I should do the resizing from a live cd since I need to unmount my /home.
2018-07-17 14:46:49	rypervenche	codedmart: I recommend reducing the home directory's file system size a bit more than you actually want, then reduce the LV size, then expand the home file system to get it to fill that extra space. That way, less chance of corrupted file system.
2018-07-17 14:46:59	+grknight	codedmart: that is safest
2018-07-17 14:47:29	codedmart	rypervenche: OK that seems like a good idea.
2018-07-17 14:47:33	codedmart	grknight: Thanks!
2018-07-17 14:47:34	rypervenche	codedmart: So long as you don't log in as a usr, you can do it on a running system. You'd have to directly log in as root from a TTY though.

2018-07-17 14:53:56	rypervenche	codedmart: It *should* do it correctly for you, but I have still seen people come out with corrupted data. It could just be because of their poorly doing it, but I would rather be safe than sorry when it comes to data.
2018-07-17 14:54:00	Kelsar	codedmart: if you make it intentionally smaller before, the chance that happens is very small
2018-07-17 14:54:14	codedmart	OK so when you say intentionally.
2018-07-17 14:54:25	Kelsar	also growing the fs does not take anytime anyways
2018-07-17 14:54:26	rypervenche	Any bug in LVM could screw it up. So I prefer to do it in two steps rather than one.
2018-07-17 14:55:03	codedmart	Are you saying use `resize2fs` then what from there?
2018-07-17 14:56:08	codedmart	`lvreduce --extents +100%FREE ...`?

2018-07-17 14:58:52	codedmart	Or are you saying `resize2fs ... 335G` which is 50GB then `lvreduce -L 55GB ...` then regrow it to take up remaining space?

2018-07-17 15:06:05	rypervenche	codedmart: This probably goes without saying, but have you verified that you have the available space in your home file system? df -hT will show you how much free space is on the file system.
2018-07-17 15:06:54	codedmart	OK so that means `resize2fs /dev/mapper/vgcrypt-home 334G` 51GB reduction then `lvreduce -L -50G /dev/mapper/vgcrypt-home`? Then `resize2fs` again?
